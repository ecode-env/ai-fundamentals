# AI Fundamentals

A hands-on collection of exercises and example implementations covering the core concepts of artificial intelligence. This project explores:

- **Search algorithms** (uninformed & informed)
- **Knowledge representation** (logic, semantic networks)
- **Machine learning basics** (regression, classification)
- **Probabilistic models** (Bayesâ€™ theorem, Markov decision processes)
- **Neural networks fundamentals** (perceptron, backpropagation)

All code is written in Python, with step-by-step notebooks and clear explanations aimed at beginners who want to build a solid foundation in AI. Feel free to clone, experiment, and contribute your own exercises!
